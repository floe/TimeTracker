# TimeTracker

## "Cloudless", minimalistic personal time tracking app

All time tracking apps I could find were ...
  * completely overloaded with features
  * bugged me with advertisements
  * needed some sort of cloud service to work
  * did not have working support for Android Wear
  
For that reason, I've written my own TimeTracker, which...
  * is open-source and ad-free
  * works locally and offline
  * uses notifications to trigger actions
  * supports Android wear
  
Enjoy!
